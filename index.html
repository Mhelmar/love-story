        <h2>Dear Jhoyce,</h2>
        <p>Every moment with you is magical. This page is just for us! 😊</p>
        
        <h2>Our Journey Together 💖</h2>
        <div class="love-story">
            <p>It started in the most unexpected way—something casual, something reckless. No commitments, no promises, just fleeting moments in dimly lit rooms. We weren’t supposed to mean anything to each other. But beyond the tangled sheets and quiet nights, something changed. Somehow, in the midst of all the chaos, we became something more than just two lost souls seeking comfort. We laughed, we talked, we understood each other in ways neither of us expected. And maybe, just maybe, that was where everything truly began.</p>
            
            <p>At first, it was simple: late-night talks, stolen kisses, tangled sheets. We didn’t talk much about the future. She talked about her past, the pain she had endured, the ghosts that still haunted her. In the stillness of the night, she unraveled the parts of herself she had kept hidden for so long. I listened, comforting her in the ways I could, but I barely spoke of my own past. It was easier to keep my own wounds buried, to let her healing take priority over my own. It was all about the moment, fulfilling needs without emotional attachments. But fate had other plans.</p>
            
            <p>Slowly, something shifted. The silence between us became comfortable, not empty. The laughter that once followed our encounters started lingering in the air, making everything feel less transactional. Our late-night talks deepened, stretching into dawn. We began sharing more than just our bodies—thoughts, fears, dreams. I caught myself remembering the way she smiled at random moments. She started looking for me in the smallest ways, and I started realizing that I wanted to be there, not just for the nights, but for everything in between.</p>
            
            <p>I had been staying at her place for a couple of weeks, just going with the flow, not questioning where this was leading. She wasn’t from here—she was only in the city for her board exam review, and soon enough, she would be heading back home. I should have known better than to let myself get attached. But one night, everything nearly fell apart.</p>

	    <p>I was looking for something when I noticed it—a condom packet, peeking from beneath the bed next to the trash bin. My heart clenched, my mind spiraled. Was I not the only one? Was this all still just casual for her? Fury and jealousy surged through me before I could stop myself.</p>

	    <p>"Is there someone else?" I demanded, my voice sharper than I intended.</p>

	    <p>She looked confused at first, then followed my gaze. And then she laughed, a soft, amused chuckle that only fueled my frustration. Then, her voice softened, and she barely met my eyes. "I thought everything was just normal. I thought this meant nothing to you."</p>

	    <p>The way she said it made something inside me snap. The words left my mouth before I could stop them. "Do I stay here if it was all nothing?"</p>

	    <p>I didn’t wait for her response. My frustration, my confusion, and the weight of emotions I had kept locked away were too much. I turned and walked out of the bedroom, settling onto the couch in the living area next to it. The room felt colder than before. We didn’t talk after that. I barely spoke, and she didn’t force me to.</p>

	    <p>For the first time, silence between us wasn’t comfortable—it was heavy.</p>

	    <p>But as I lay there on the couch, staring at the ceiling, my mind wouldn’t let it go. Do I need to trust her? Could I believe that it wasn’t hers? That it had belonged to the last owner of the apartment and was simply left behind? The rational part of me told me I was overthinking, but the insecurity gnawed at my chest. I didn’t want to be just another option. I didn’t want to be temporary.</p>

	    <p>I had already made up my mind—I was going to leave. I had washed everything that could be washed, cleaned everything that could be cleaned. I didn’t want to leave anything behind, not even a trace of me in her space. But before stepping out, I found myself hesitating. I checked on her one last time.</p>

	    <p>She was trembling in her sleep again. She always did. I had seen it countless times before and knew why—her past haunted her, creeping into her nights, twisting her dreams into nightmares. But ever since I had moved in, it had gotten better. I could tell. The shaking wasn’t as bad, the fear in her face while she slept wasn’t as intense.</p>

	    <p>I stood there, watching her, unable to ignore the tightness in my chest. I paced back and forth, glancing at her every few moments, debating with myself. Should I really leave? Could I walk away knowing that, once again, she might be alone with her nightmares? That she might wake up shaking, gasping for breath with no one there to comfort her?</p>

	    <p>I thought I had made up my mind, but the moment I saw her stir in her sleep, I knew the truth. I couldn't leave her. Not now. Not when she needed me the most.</p>

	    <p>Because somewhere along the way, she had become more than just a temporary part of my life.</p>

	    <p>She had become my home.</p>

	    <p>After that night, I stayed.</p>

	    <p>When we woke up the next morning, she brought it up first. She sat up in bed, looking at me, her voice quiet but firm. "It wasn’t mine," she said. "Trust me. I never had anyone else. It was only you."</p>

	    <p>Her words hung in the air, waiting for me to take them as truth. I looked at her, searching for any hint of dishonesty, but all I saw was sincerity. And for the first time in a long time, I let myself believe her.</p>

	    <p>Days passed, and something between us changed. There was an unspoken understanding, an acknowledgment that neither of us wanted to say out loud. I noticed how she lingered near me more, how she started holding onto my arm absentmindedly. I was always there, in her space, and somehow, it felt right.</p>

	    <p>My love for her didn’t start because of what was happening between us—it started and grew while I was with her. I saw her for who she truly was, beyond the quiet nights and casual beginnings. I understood her—the warmth in her laughter, the kindness in her heart, the love she didn’t even realize she was giving. And in that realization, I knew: This was the woman I loved.</p>

	    <p>Then one day, a storm hit. We were stranded in the apartment, with no electricity and dying phone batteries. With nothing else to do, we talked. It was just like our usual late-night conversations, but something about that night felt different—more real, more pressing.</p>

	    <p>Eventually, I brought up what we had been avoiding. "What happens to us now?" I asked. "Where are we taking this?"</p>

	    <p>She hesitated before answering. "I don’t know. What do you want?"</p>

	    <p>I took a deep breath, my heart pounding against my ribs. The storm outside raged on, but in that moment, all I could focus on was her. "Can you be my girlfriend?"</p>

	    <p>She looked at me, surprised. The flickering candlelight cast shadows across her face, making her unreadable. Then, after what felt like an eternity, she smiled. A real, genuine smile.</p>

	    <p>"Yes."</p>

	    <p>That night, as the storm continued to surge outside, something else settled between us—something undeniable, something certain.</p>

	<p>We were no longer just two people lost in the dark. We had found each other, and this time, neither of us wanted to let go.</p>

	<p>Being together wasn’t just about sweet moments and whispered confessions. It was about learning each other’s routines, quirks, and flaws. We fell into a rhythm—morning coffee, shared meals, lazy afternoons spent doing nothing and everything. The comfort of simply existing in the same space felt natural, but with it came the growing fear of what lay ahead.</p>

	<p>She still had her exams to take, and after that, she’d have to go back home. The thought of her leaving lingered in the background like an unspoken storm. We didn’t talk about it—not yet. We were too busy holding onto the present, afraid that speaking about the future would break the fragile happiness we had built.</p>

	<p>But time had a way of reminding us that nothing stayed the same forever. And soon, we would have to face the reality of what it meant to truly love each other.</p>

	<p>The days that followed were some of the happiest we had ever known. We fell into each other effortlessly, like two pieces of a puzzle finally finding their place. She studied late into the night, and I was there beside her, making coffee, listening as she mumbled formulas and medical terms under her breath.</p>

	<p>She was stressed but determined. And I? I was simply in awe of her.</p>

	<p>We didn’t talk about what would happen after the exam, but it loomed over us like a shadow we tried to ignore. It was easier to pretend that time was on our side, that we could exist in this little bubble forever. But bubbles always pop. And the closer her exam date got, the more reality set in.</p>

	<p>One night, as she closed her review book with a sigh, I saw it in her eyes—the worry she was trying to hide.</p>

	<p>“What’s wrong?” I asked, though I already knew.</p>

	<p>She hesitated, biting her lip. “I’ve been thinking… about the exam.”</p>

	<p>I stayed quiet, letting her find the words.</p>

	<p>“I don’t think I’m ready,” she finally admitted. “I thought I could do it, but I’m scared. I don’t want to take it just to fail.”</p>

	<p>The weight of her words pressed down on my chest. I knew how much she had pushed herself, how much pressure she carried. “Then don’t force it,” I said gently. “It’s okay to wait until you’re ready.”</p>

	<p>She nodded, relief and uncertainty flickering in her eyes. “I think I need to go home for now. Clear my head. Be with my family.”</p>

	<p>I swallowed hard, forcing a smile. “I understand.”</p>

	<p>And just like that, our plans changed. She packed her bags, and instead of taking the exam, she went home. We promised to make the long distance work, to stay connected, to keep loving each other despite the miles between us. And at first, we did.</p>
	
	
	<p>My love, my forever, my happiness. From the moment you became a part of my life, everything changed for the better. You are the light in my darkest days, the warmth in my coldest nights, and the calm in my stormiest moments. Like a perfect lab result, you bring balance and harmony to my world. You are not just a part of my life—you are the very reason it feels complete.</p>

	<p>Your love is my cure, my antidote, my greatest discovery. No medicine, no remedy in the world could ever compare to the healing power of your presence. With you, every worry fades, and every doubt disappears. No microscope is needed to see how much I love you because it is evident in every heartbeat, in every breath, in every moment we share.</p>

	<p>You are the rhythm to my heart, the steady pulse that keeps me going. Like a perfectly mixed solution, we blend together in a way that feels effortless, natural, and destined. Every time I look at you, I see the most beautiful combination of love, kindness, strength, and passion. You inspire me to be better, to dream bigger, and to love deeper than I ever thought possible.</p>

	<p>Just like a scientist carefully studies every detail under a microscope, I take my time cherishing every part of you—your laughter that brightens my days, your voice that soothes my soul, and your love that makes everything in this world feel right. You are my most precious discovery, one I will spend my whole life exploring, understanding, and loving more each day.</p>

	<p>No test tube or experiment could measure the depth of my love for you. It is infinite, boundless, and unwavering. In every challenge, in every victory, in every moment of joy or sorrow, I will always be by your side. No distance, no time, no obstacle can ever change that.</p>

	<p>You are my safe place, my home, the love I will always choose—today, tomorrow, and for all the days to come. Forever and always, I am yours.</p>

	<p>I love you, endlessly and unconditionally.</p>
